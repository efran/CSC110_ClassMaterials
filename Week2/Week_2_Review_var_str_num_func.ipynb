    "## Review: Variables, Strings, Numbers, and Functions\n",
    "So far, you have been introduced to the basic way to store data in a program - variables.<br>\n",
    "You have used variables to store strings and numbers, including data obtained from a user.<br>\n",
    "You have seen how variables can be combined with other variables, strings, and numbers (and when this doesn't work so well).<br>\n",
    "You have used variables that store numbers in mathematical expressions.<br>\n",
    "And you have used variables that store strings in combination with the + and * operators.<br><br>\n",
    "This week, you were also introduced to functions.<br>\n",
    "Functions let you store blocks of code that complete a specific task.<br>\n",
    "Functions are one way to make your code modular -- this makes it easier to read, understand, and reuse.\n",
    "The code cell below demos some of what we have covered so far."
